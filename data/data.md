# Open source retail dataset


### Downloading the dataset
The data has been uploaded to Git Large File Storage. Install git-lfs [here](https://git-lfs.github.com/).


### Context

Data in this repository was extracted from the open source dataset ["The Complete Journey"](https://www.dunnhumby.com/source-files). This dataset contains household level transactions over two years from a group of 2,500 households who are frequent shoppers at a retailer. It contains all of each householdâ€™s purchases, not just those from a limited number of categories. For certain households, demographic information as well as direct marketing contact history are included.

This dataset provides a starting point for feature engineering, customer segmentation, and simulator design.


### Data Glossary

This dataset contains more tables, as well as transaction information, than we may need at this stage to construct the first version of the simulator. You may find the following tables useful to start with.
